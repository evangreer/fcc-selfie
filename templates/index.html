<h1>@FCC killing Net Neutrality? Send them a selfie...<br/>...with your cable bill!</h1>

<h2>
    The FCC is caving to Comcast and trying to kill net neutrality. Once they do,
    we’ll be paying even more each month to monopoly ISPs. So we’re sending them
    our cable bills. Print your bill, remove your info, and snap a selfie with it.
    BONUS: write them an angry note <strong>on your cable bill</strong> about
    why the net neutrality rules matter. We'll deliver your selfie to the FCC!

            <strong>
                Net Neutrality is on the chopping block.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The FCC's new chairman Ajit Pai — a former Verizon lobbyist — is
            planning to strike down the Net Neutrality protections that millions of
            Americans fought for. Without Net Neutrality, big ISPs like Comcast or
            Time Warner cable can charge exorbitant fees for access to an Internet
            “fast lane” or even censor web sites entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
            These same ISPs are tied to mainstream media
            conglomerates that own and control so much of what people see
            and hear on TV, the radio, movies, and the Internet. Without
            Net Neutrality, these companies will be free to
            squeeze Internet media out of the picture and further control
            America's access to information.

            They believe they have a "Free Speech" right to censor the Internet.
            </a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Net Neutrality has been framed as a partisan issue by globalist
            Republican Congressmen who have received millions in donations from
            ISPs and media companies. But in reality, Net Neutrality is essential to
            protecting the Internet as a free market of ideas and competitive
            enterprise.
